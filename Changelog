2020-04-26:
- Adapted script to Kubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Added creation of status.sh script to check mount status of shared folder
- Fixed fail2ban service start error due to missing log file
- Made PHP version configurable
- Made sure shared folder is mounted in the install steps
- Worked around nextcloud bug (data directory cannot be a symlink at the moment)

2018-07-16:
- Fixed severe bug: Data folder was not the shared folder from VirtualBox but a VM internal folder. That potentially flooded the VM disk to its limit.
- Adapted script for Kubuntu 18.04 LTS

Initial Version:
- Combined German guideline and other online sources into own install script for setting up an nextcloud VM with Kubuntu 16.04 LTS behind nginx for private use with dyndns
